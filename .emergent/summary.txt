A React-based landing page () has been created and heavily modified based on continuous user feedback. The page includes all requested sections: a hero section, tour package cards (for Kashmir and International destinations), a trust-building section, and a footer. A lead capture form is implemented both as a modal that appears on page load and as a static section on the page. All form submissions are currently **mocked** using , and the backend is not yet integrated.

        - Using a specific red logo ().
        - Changing the page background to white and removing the previous black background.
        - Making the Enquire buttons have a black background with white text.
        - Reducing the font size of the hero section text for a more professional look.
        - Making the logo in the footer bigger with white text.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? screenshot tool
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no outstanding bugs. The primary focus is completing the current design iteration and then moving to backend development.

**In progress Task List**:
  - Task 1:  Finalize and Verify Latest Design Changes (P0)
     - Where to resume: The agent has just finished editing  to apply the latest user requests. The next step is to use the  tool to capture the new design and present it to the user for verification.
     - What will be achieved with this? The landing page's visual design will align with the user's most recent and specific feedback.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend
     - Blocked on something: None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
    Upcoming Tasks:
    - **Task 1: Backend Integration for Lead Capture Form (P0):**
        - Create a new POST endpoint (e.g., ) in  to handle form submissions.
        - Create a new MongoDB collection (e.g., ) to store the form data: Full Name, Phone, Email, Destination, Travel Date, and Number of Travelers.
        - Update the frontend in  to make an API call to this new endpoint upon form submission, replacing the current mock functionality.
    - **Task 2: Implement Thank You Confirmation (P1):**
        - After a successful form submission, display a thank-you confirmation message to the user, as requested in the initial requirements. This can be done using a toast notification or by replacing the form with a success message.

**Completed work in this session**
- Created the initial landing page structure () with all required sections.
- Implemented a lead capture form, available both as a pop-up modal and an in-page section.
- Added a WhatsApp click-to-chat button.
- Sourced and integrated images for various tour packages (Kashmir, Maldives, Dubai, Thailand).
- Iteratively refined the UI/UX through multiple cycles of user feedback, including:
  - Adjusting the color scheme several times (red/orange, black/white, and finally red/white).
  - Changing company name in the header from Tripoday India Pvt Ltd to Tripoday Holidays.
  - Modifying button shapes from rectangular to circular and back.
  - Updating component backgrounds (header, footer, hero section).
  - Resizing logos and text to meet user specifications.
- Added a new Tulip Festival Kashmir package to the listings.
- Removed the Made with Emergent badge using a CSS override.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - Issue 1: The Made with Emergent badge proved difficult to remove. The agent attempted to remove it from  and other scripts but was unsuccessful, indicating it's likely injected by the development environment.
     - Fix applied: A CSS rule () was added to  to hide the badge.
     - Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this? While visually hidden, the underlying injection mechanism was not addressed. A cleaner fix would be to identify the source and disable it, but the current workaround is functional.
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix: Frontend
     - Is recurring issue? Y

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Database**: MongoDB (via )
- **Development Strategy**: Frontend-first development with mocked data.

**key DB schema**
  - : {id: str, client_name: str, timestamp: datetime} (existing)
  -  (to be created): 

**changes in tech stack**
  - None

**All files of reference**
- : Created and modified multiple times to build the entire landing page UI.
- : Created to provide mock data for tour packages and form submissions.
- : Modified to update metadata and add a CSS override to hide an injected badge.
- : Modified to render the  component.
- : Modified to include custom styles for the landing page.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- ****: This file has grown into a large, monolithic component containing the logic and markup for the entire page. For better maintainability, it should be refactored into smaller, reusable components (e.g., , , , ).
- **CSS Badge Hack**: The CSS override in  to hide the Made with Emergent badge is a workaround. A more robust solution would be to identify and disable the script injecting it.

**key api endpoints**
- **Existing**: , 
- **To Be Created**: A  endpoint is required to handle the lead capture form.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The user provides highly specific and frequent feedback on visual design. Be prepared for iterative UI changes.
- The top priority after completing the current design update is to implement the backend for the lead capture form, as it is the core objective of the page and is currently mocked.
- Be aware that the development environment appears to inject a Made with Emergent badge. A CSS hack is in place to hide it, but the root cause is unknown.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- A WhatsApp click-to-chat link () is implemented. No other 3rd party integrations are present.

**Testing status**
  - Testing agent used after significant changes: NO
  - Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
  - Test files created: None
  - Known regressions: None

**Credentials to test flow:**
N/A

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent has not yet implemented the Thank-you confirmation message after form submission, which was an initial requirement. This should be prioritized along with the backend integration.
- The agent did not proactively refactor the  component as it grew, leading to a large, monolithic file that is harder to maintain.</analysis>
